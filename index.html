          Northeastern has just hired you to make the student center more efficient and friendly. Pick a location and spend an hour people watching with a notebook and pencil. Spend some time watching the kinds of activities that people are engaged in, and think about how technology could help improve these activities. Pick one such activity to focus on and study. For your chosen activity watch several people perform the task and make detailed notes about the series of steps they go through, any objects (“artifacts”) they use, whether they interact with other people and, if so, the step-by-step details of this interaction. Conduct two or three unstructured interviews with your subjects.
          <br/><br/>
          Some examples of activities (you can study one of these or, better yet, come up with your own):
          <ul>
            <li>finding a seat</li>
            <li>choosing a restaurant</li>
            <li>finding a meeting room</li>
            <li>deciding whether to take the stairs or elevator</li>
          </ul>
          <strong>What to Post:</strong><br/>
          Your report should include a one-paragraph summary of why you picked your particular activity to focus on, followed by an overview of the activity, the kinds of people you observed engaging in it, and a description of any artifacts they used. Describe the individuals you interviewed (not by name) and what you learned from the interviews. Following this, provide a detailed description of the activity and any variations you observed. Review the two papers assigned this class for examples of how to write your report.  You can include sketches or photographs. Total report length should be 2-3 pages.

        </h5>

        <p>
          For this assignment I decided to go to the Reflecting Pool to observe people playing the new mobile game, Pokemon GO. The Reflecting Pool is an extremely popular area for playing this game, and I intended to figure out why. I knew beforehand that there was a high density of Pokemon at this location and it provided a good place to capture them with minimal effort, but it was unclear at first why anyone would choose this place over a different Pokemon-dense location. To begin my observations, I went to the Reflecting Pool on a nice day and sat down to play the game myself while still taking note of the behavior of other players around me.
        </p>

        </h5>

        <p>
          <strong>What is the activity?<br/></strong>
          Pokemon GO is a popular new mobile game in which players move about the real world to capture in-game monsters called Pokemon. The game uses geolocation data to place these characters on each player's map. The type of Pokemon that appear in a given area is typically constant, but may shuffle one a month. Areas with more cellular signal traffic are more likely to offer a larger population of Pokemon. The game also contains Pokestops - high population areas where players can collect items once every 5 minutes. Some of these items can be used to catch and collect Pokemon that are found while walking around. Another way to obtain Pokemon is by walking long distances while incubating Pokemon eggs. Eggs are a rare item found at Pokestops. Each player begins the game with a single incubator and can place an egg inside to start hatching it. Additional incubators can be purchased from the in-game store. Last, there is a combat system for players to compete to capture territories called "gyms." At the start of the game, players choose 1 of 3 teams to represent. Players fight to capture and hold the gyms for their respective teams. In-game medals are used to track player progress, but do not offer any inherent advantages or benefits. Because there is no clear end-goal, each player's objective may be different than the next.
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Who is doing the activity?<br/></strong>
          I observed that people who passed through the Reflecting Pool on their way to other places were sometimes, but mostly not, playing this game. However, those who were spending time sitting, standing, or walking around the pool were much more likely to be playing the game. Most of the people playing the game were in the neighborhood of 10 to 30 years old. There was no noticeable difference in player gender or race, but perhaps observing at a different time or in a different area would yield different results.
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Any artifacts of the activity?<br/></strong>
          The primary artifact of this activity is the cell phone. Every player must have one because the game is only available via iOS and Android. Additional artifacts I observed people using were external batteries and charge packs, headphones, skateboards, bikes, and roller blades. The external battiers and charge packs were used to play for longer without stopping. Headphones were used to listen to music and other media while playing the game. Finally, these several modes of transportation were used to get around with less effort and to travel further distances.
        </p>

          <a id="hci-individual-assignment-3-interviews" class="anchor" href="#hci-individual-assignment-3-interviews" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Interviews
        </h5>

        <p>
          <strong>Describe the individuals you interviewed<br/></strong>
          The first person interviewed was a young, male, college student. He attended a nearby university and was at the Reflecting Pool to kill time between classes. He brought with him a phone and a set of headphones to play the game, but mentioned he would spend some time doing other things while there were no nearby Pokemon to catch.
          <br/><br/>
          The second interview was actually with a group of people. I approached a family where the 2 children were playing the game. The parents were both in their late 30s. The kids were 8 and 10 years old. Mom had gone shopping nearby and dad took the kids to the Reflecting Pool to give mom the time she needed to finish shopping. He seemed pretty invested in the kid's gameplay. Although he was not playing himself, he did help them when they needed it. The kids mentioned that they didn't usually fight at gyms, but they really wanted to catch as many different Pokemon as possible. Dad had brought some external battery packs with him so the kids could play for longer if their phone batteries died. This was the only non-phone artifact with them at the time.
          <br/><br/>
          <strong>Describe what you learned from the interviews<br/></strong>
          These interviews taught me that a lot of the people playing this game are only doing so to kill time between other activities. Typically the game is not the primary focus, but instead a way to use free time before another obligation. This was somewhat surprising to me. Considering the success of the game, I would have expected users to be more interested in playing the game by itself.

        </h5>

        <p>
          <strong>Provide a detailed description of the activity<br/></strong>
          Although I can't say for certain what the users are doing on their individual phones, I can comment on the observations I made while they were playing the game. There were 2 different types of users I observed during my time at the Reflecting Pool. The first would remain in place, likely taking advantage of a Pokestop near that location and would only move if a Pokestop's lure expired. These players were more likely to have external battery packs and headphones. They were also more likely to be playing alone, but not always. The second type of player is a more active one. They would walk in circles around the Reflecting Pool, hitting all the Pokestops on the way, and catching some Pokemon too. These players were typically in small groups of 2 or 3 and did not have any non-phone artifacts.<br/><br/>
          <strong>Provide a list of any variations you observed<br/></strong>
          The primary variation that I observed was the huge gender gap in type 1 players. Almost all of the players I observed playing alone were male.<br/><br/>

            Find 2 examples of good user interface design, and 2 examples of bad user interface design.
            <br/><br/>
            Your examples should be specific. It's very hard to find a large interface that's completely good or completely bad, so don't try. Instead, focus on a particular feature or aspect of a user interface that makes your case. Avoid fuzzy words like “intuitive” and “user-friendly”. Find concrete reasons for your judgment.
            <br/><br/>
            You aren't limited to desktop software. Web sites offer many great candidates for fame and shame. You aren't even limited to traditional computer interfaces. Feel free to go out into the real world, and consider consumer appliances, car dashboards, building entrances, traffic intersections, shower controls, etc.
            <br/><br/>
            Your report should include 2 good examples and 2 bad examples. For each example:
            <ul>
              <li>describe the purpose of the overall interface</li>
              <li>describe the particular aspect you find good or bad</li>
              <li>explain why it's good or bad (please make explicit reference to the principles covered on 9/8: visibility, mapping, feedback, consistency, etc).</li>
              <li>if bad, speculate why it might have been designed that way, and suggest a better design if possible</li>
              <li>illustrate with screenshots or photographs</li>

          </h5>

          <p>
            I personally really enjoy using Facebook Messenger. There are a few things that it does better than other messaging clients, but for the most part it is like the competition. However, it isn't the functionality that I enjoy the most from Messenger, it's the user experience. Creating new messages to new people is exteremely simple, as is creating a new group of friends to start a conversation with. Here is what users see when they first log in to the service.
            <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/HCI/IP2/messenger_home.png">
            <br/><br/>
            One aspect of Facebook Messenger that is very good is it's capability for group messaging. It is both internally and externally consistent with common group conversation applications. Messenger allows you to add as few or as many people to the conversation as you'd like, and you don't need to be Facebook friends with them to do so. Here are a few things that make Messenger really stick out from the competition:
            <ul>
              <li>Simple Design</li>
              It look nice and it is very easy to navigate the application.
              <li>User Control and Freedom</li>
              For group conversations, I can easily add, remove, or edit members of the group.
              <li>Quick User Feedback</li>
              When a message is sent or received, a nice sound effect is played.
              <li>Speak the User's Language</li>
              The page uses extremely simple words. There is never a setting you don't understand.
              <li>Prevent Errors</li>
              In all my time using this application I have never once run into a system error.
            </ul>
            Below are some more screenshots of me using this application to edit some group settings.

          </h5>

          <p>
            I really enjoyed setting up this webpage using GitHub Pages. When you first navigate to the site, there is an introductory video to help you get started. Once you've watched it and decided GitHub Pages is the tool you need for your job, they offer step-by-step instructions on how to get your first webpage up and running in minutes. From idea to reality, this page only took about a half hour to get fully set up and ready for homework submissions.
            <br/><br/>

            <br/><br/>
            The part of this application that I liked the most was the step-by-step instructions it gave you to set up and publish your first template. It took me less than 10 minutes to set up a simple template with example text on my custom domain. Below are some of the aspects of GitHub Pages that really stood out to me:
            <ul>
              <li>Simple Design</li>
              This page is extremely simple. It only offers you the information you absolutely need at the start.
              <li>Quick User Feedback</li>
              Feedback is immediate. The template you choose will show up at your domain very quickly.
              <li>Speak the User's Language</li>
              Despite GitHub being a home to a more "techie" crowd, I thought GitHub Pages kept it understandable.
              <li>Help and Documentation</li>
              At the bottom of the introduction page, there is a ton of documentation available via a link.
            </ul>
            Below are some more screenshots of the step-by-step instructions and steps you can take once you start to get a hang of web development.

          </h5>

          <p>
            While my girlfriend was trying to register for a few yoga classes, she was having a very hard time navigating the webiste for the school, Sadhana Boston. It is not so hard to find classes and who is teaching them, but it is very difficult to find where a list of prices for each class. The rest of the site is pretty well set up, but prices should be a little more accessible.
            <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/HCI/IP2/sadhana_home.png">
            <br/><br/>
            The primary issue with finding the rates for yoga classes was that to find that page, you had to navigate through a sub-menu with a title that was not clearly marked to contain such information. Under the "About" tab, there is another option for "Rates and Policies." Because there were other menu tabs named "Schedule," and "Classes," I would not have expected to need to navigate to the "About" tab. A better way to organize this would have been to have the prices in the "Classes" tab or to allow users to click on a given class to see it's associated price. Here are a few other notable issues we had with the webiste.
            <ul>
              <li>Simple Design</li>
              Overall, the design is fine, but finding the prices was particularly difficult.
              <li>Consistency</li>
              It was not clear at the start that some of the menu tabs had sub-menu options.
              <li>Help and Documentation</li>
              There was no clear way for me to look at a list of all the available tab or anything like that.
              <li>Minimize User Memory Load</li>
              If you find your class in the "Classes" tab, you have to navigate to the "About-Rates" tab to find that price for that class. 
            </ul>
            Below are some screenshots of me using this application to demonstrate the path I took to find rates.

          </h5>

          <p>
            Tomorrow, September 20th, the final DLC for the console video game "Destiny" releases. In anticipation of it's release, I have been using a website called the100. This site is used to organize playgroups and find similar players to game with. My biggest problem with this service is that it is very hard to communicate with other users quickly. They offer an in-client text messaging service, but it does not update in real time rendering it essentially useless. When users show up in groups asking to join and play, I would have to refresh the page in order to see their messages. In addition, users are supposed to sign up for playgroups in advance, so that when the time comes to play everyone is ready. However, there is no way to hold people accountable for actually showing up except for a "karma" system that no one pays attention to.
            <br/><br/>
            <img src="images/HCI/IP2/the100_home.png">
            <br/><br/>
            As you can see from the image, the layout of the website is fairly simple. The main focus of the site is on the users and groups, but there should be an equal amount of attention paid to communication between the two. Currently it is too hard to get in contact with members of any given group without using outside tools.
            <ul>
              <li>Simple Design</li>
              Overall, the design is fine, but communicating with other group members can be very difficult.
              <li>Consistency</li>
              The layout and buttons are internally consistent, but the text chat does not behave like any other text chat I have used before.
              <li>Quick User Feedback</li>
              This is the biggest problem. There is zero feedback to the user when sending and receiving messages.
            </ul>
            Below are some screenshots of me browsing some pages of this application.
