          <p>Well... the .mi domain doesn't exist yet, so I was forced to settle for less. The .me domain was unfortunately the best I could do. People spell it incorrectly this way all the time anyway.</p>

            <p>Find 2 examples of good user interface design, and 2 examples of bad user interface design.
              <br/><br/>
              Your examples should be specific. It's very hard to find a large interface that's completely good or completely bad, so don't try. Instead, focus on a particular feature or aspect of a user interface that makes your case. Avoid fuzzy words like “intuitive” and “user-friendly”. Find concrete reasons for your judgment.
              <br/><br/>
              You aren't limited to desktop software. Web sites offer many great candidates for fame and shame. You aren't even limited to traditional computer interfaces. Feel free to go out into the real world, and consider consumer appliances, car dashboards, building entrances, traffic intersections, shower controls, etc.
              <br/><br/>
              Your report should include 2 good examples and 2 bad examples. For each example:
              <ul>
                <li>describe the purpose of the overall interface</li>
                <li>describe the particular aspect you find good or bad</li>
                <li>explain why it's good or bad (please make explicit reference to the principles covered on 9/8: visibility, mapping, feedback, consistency, etc).</li>
                <li>if bad, speculate why it might have been designed that way, and suggest a better design if possible</li>
                <li>illustrate with screenshots or photographs</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            </h5>

            <p>
              I personally really enjoy using Facebook Messenger. There are a few things that it does better than other messaging clients, but for the most part it is like the competition. However, it isn't the functionality that I enjoy the most from Messenger, it's the user experience. Creating new messages to new people is exteremely simple, as is creating a new group of friends to start a conversation with. Here is what users see when they first log in to the service.

              One aspect of Facebook Messenger that is very good is it's capability for group messaging. It is both internally and externally consistent with common group conversation applications. Messenger allows you to add as few or as many people to the conversation as you'd like, and you don't need to be Facebook friends with them to do so. Here are a few things that make Messenger really stick out from the competition:
              <ul>
                <li>Simple Design</li>
                It look nice and it is very easy to navigate the application.
                <li>User Control and Freedom</li>
                For group conversations, I can easily add, remove, or edit members of the group.
                <li>Quick User Feedback</li>
                When a message is sent or received, a nice sound effect is played.
                <li>Speak the User's Language</li>
                The page uses extremely simple words. There is never a setting you don't understand.
                <li>Prevent Errors</li>
                In all my time using this application I have never once run into a system error.
              </ul>
              Below are some more screenshots of me using this application to edit some group settings.
